                            <p>
                                On December 21, 2017, 26-year-old Ian Austin Mascarenhas, working in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, came down on a month's vacation to visit his ailing mother Anna (battling ovarian cancer since two years) and to spend Christmas with the family.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On the next day, in the evening, he met with a tragic car accident near A J Hospital in the city and succumbed to his head injuries in the wee hours of the morning. This tragic incident stands out to be a major blow which shattered the life of his parents, his only sister, and his dear relatives.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ian Austin was an energetic youngster with many inborn talents who, at his different stages of life, had amassed a great number of friends. He was a fun-loving, kind-hearted friend who was always available when his presence was needed at any dire state.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For this very reason, his parents offered to donate his organs on the night of his departure to the youth in need, so that he could live beyond his life. Unfortunately, this was not to be, as all his organs had failed by the time he had breathed his last. They could only donate his eyes to the eye bank at A J Hospital in Mangalore. Today, two persons are seeing the light of day through Ian's eyes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Following Ian's passing away, his numerous friends, from different regions, religions, and languages, prevailed upon his parents to start a charity so that his memory and good deeds are preserved for posterity. This is how the idea of forming a foundation called 'Ian Cares' took its shape.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We are fortunate to be associated with a few distinguished personalities from different walks of life who have agreed to become the trustees of this foundation, besides the family members.

After his tragic passing in 2017, his family turned grief into a mission to fight the “3 Ds” — Drinks, Drugs, and Depression — helping others find strength and purpose again.
